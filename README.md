## Deps

```clojure
[reifyhealth/specmonstah "2.0.0-alpha-2"]
```

## Rationale

Specmonstah (Boston for "Specmonster") lets you write test fixtures
that are clear, concise, and easy to maintain. It's great for
dramatically reducing test boilerplate.

Say you have a forum and you want to test a scenario where a post has
gotten three likes by three different users. You'd first have to
create a hierarchy of records for the post, topic, topic category, and
user. You have to make sure that all the foreign keys are correct
(e.g. the post's `:topic-id` is set to the topic's `:id`) and that
everything is inserted in the right order.

With Specmonstah, all you have to do is **write code like** this:

```clojure
(insert {:like [[3]]})
```

and **these records get inserted** in a database (in the order
displayed):

```clojure
[[:user {:id 1 :username "T2TD3pAB79X5"}]
 [:user {:id 2 :username "ziJ9GnvNMOHcaUz"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 3 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:topic {:id 6
          :topic-category-id 3
          :title "4juV71q9Ih9eE1"
          :created-by-id 2
          :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:post {:id 10 :topic-id 6 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:like {:id 14 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 1}]
 [:like {:id 17 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 2}]
 [:user {:id 20 :username "b73Ts5BoO"}]
 [:like {:id 21 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 20}]]
```

Without Specmonstah, you'd have to write something like this to
achieve the same result:

```clojure
(let [user-1 (create-user! {:username "u1" :email "e1@example.co"})
      user-2 (create-user! {:username "u2" :email "e2@example.co"})
      user-3 (create-user! {:username "u3" :email "e3@example.co"})
      tc     (create-topic-category! {:created-by-id (:id user-1), :updated-by-id (:id user-1)})
      t      (create-topic! {:title             "topic"
                             :created-by-id     (:id user-1)
                             :updated-by-id     (:id user-1)
                             :topic-category-id (:id tc)})
      p      (create-post! {:topic-id (:id t), :created-by-id, (:id user-1), :updated-by-id (:id user-1)})]
  (create-like! {:user-id (:id user-1) :post-id (:id p)})
  (create-like! {:user-id (:id user-2) :post-id (:id p)})
  (create-like! {:user-id (:id user-3) :post-id (:id p)}))
```

Call me crazy, but I think `(insert {:like [[3]]})` is better. The
Specmonstah DSL communicates what's important about the scenario
you're trying to test. It elimiinates all the visual noise that
results from having to type out the foreign key relationships.

## I know this README is hella long but read this part at least

This README is long af. Total bummer, I know. I'm sorry. If all this
text makes you want to run screaming for the hills, then all I ask is
that you first check out the [Short Sweet
Example](#short-sweet-example). It's some code that you can play with
in a REPL that demonstrates some of the power and fun of using
Specmonstah.

If that hooks you, then the rest of the README will walk you through
Specmonstah's features and usage. SM is a specialized tool that
introduces new concepts and vocabulary. It will take an hour or two to
get comfortable with it, but once you do, that investment will pay
huge dividends over time as you use it to write code that is more
clear, concise, and easy to maintain. This guide has five parts to get
you there:

* The aforementioned [Short Sweet Working
  Example](#short-sweet-working-example)
* The [Infomercial](#infomercial) is a quick tour of the cool,
  surprising stuff you can do with Specmonstah, showing you why it's
  worth the investment
* A detailed [Tutorial](#tutorial) walks you through the library. It's
  written so the first sections get you productive with the core
  concepts quickly, and later sections fill in more esoteric details.
* The [Usage Reference](#usage-reference) contains at-a-glance code
  snippets demonstrating the facets of Specmonstah usage
* Because Specmonstah introduces new terms, we provide a
  [Glossary](#glossary)

## Short Sweet Example

To get started with the example, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/reifyhealth/specmonstah.git
```

Open `examples/short-sweet/src/short_sweet.clj` in your favorite
editor and start a REPL. I've also included the code below in case for
example you don't have access to a REPL because, say, you're in some
kind of _Taken_ situation and you only have access to a phone and
you're using your precious battery life to go through this README.

The first ~70 lines of code include all the setup necessary for the
examples to run, followed by snippets to try out with example
output. Def play with the snippets :) Can you generate multiple todos
or todo lists?

```clojure
(ns short-sweet

         :title        "default todo title",
         :todo-list-id 2,
         :assigned-id  1}]]
```

## Infomercial

In the time-honored tradition of infomercials everywhere, these
snippets gloss over a lot of details to reveal the truest, purest
essence of a product. If you want to go all FDA on me and validate the
claims, check out [the full
source][imcode].

The code below will ~~shout at~~ show you how you can generate and
insert data for a forum's database. Here's an entity relationship
diagram for the database:

![Forum ERD](docs/forum-erd.png)

One thing the diagram doesn't capture is that, for the `like` type,
there's a uniqueness constraint on `post-id` and
`created-by-id`. Also, every instance of `created-by-id` and
`updated-by-id` refers to a user, but including that in the diagram
would just clutter it.

(You will learn later how to [declare the entity schema](#02-schemas) 
with relationship and other constraints to Specmonstah. You can also 
have a look at the `(def schema ...)` in the 
[infomercial source code][imcode].)

[imcode]: ./examples/reifyhealth/infomercial.cljc

### Insert entity hierarchy in dependency order, with correct foreign keys

Posts have a foreign key referencing a Topic, Topics reference a Topic
Category, and all of these reference a User. The snippet below shows
that you can specify that you want one Post created, and Specmonstah
will ensure that the other entities are created and inserted in
dependency order:

```clojure
(insert {:post [[1]]})
@mock-db
; =>
[[:user {:id 1 :username "K7X5r6UVs9Mm2Eks"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 2 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:topic {:id 5
          :topic-category-id 2
          :title "ejJ2B88UZo2NK2sMuU4"
          :created-by-id 1
          :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:post {:id 9 :topic-id 5 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]]
```

The `insert` function is an example of code you might write to manage
the relationship between specmonstah-generated data and your own
database. In this case, `insert` simulates inserting records in a db
by conjing entities on an `mock-db` atom. The maps were generated
using `clojure.spec`. Notice that all the foreign keys line up.

### Specify different users

In the previous example, all entities referenced the same User. In
this one, the Topic's `created-by-id` will reference a new user:

```clojure
(insert {:topic [[:t0 {:refs {:created-by-id :custom-user}}]]
         :post [[1]]})
@mock-db
; =>
[[:user {:id 1 :username "gMKGTwBnOvB0xt"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 2 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:user {:id 5 :username "2jK0TXCU2UcBM89"}]
 [:topic {:id 6
          :topic-category-id 2
          :title "cmo2Vg8DQByz302c"
          :created-by-id 5
          :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:post {:id 10 :topic-id 6 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]]
```

Two users, one with `:id 1` and another with `:id 5`. The topic's
`:created-by-id` attribute is 5, and all other User references are
`1`.

### Multiple entities

What if you want to insert 2 or 3 or more posts?

```clojure
(insert {:post [[3]]})
@mock-db
; =>
[[:user {:id 1 :username "yB96fd"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 2 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:topic {:id 5
          :topic-category-id 2
          :title "KEh29Ru7aVVg2"
          :created-by-id 1
          :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:post {:id 9 :topic-id 5 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:post {:id 13 :topic-id 5 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:post {:id 17 :topic-id 5 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]]
```

Just say "I want 3 posts" and Specmonstah delivers.

### Uniqueness constraints

You can't have two Likes that reference the same Post and User; in
other words, a User can't Like the same Post twice. Specmonstah will
automatically generate unique Users if you specify multiple Likes:

```clojure
(insert {:like [[3]]})
@mock-db
; =>
[[:user {:id 1 :username "T2TD3pAB79X5"}]
 [:user {:id 2 :username "ziJ9GnvNMOHcaUz"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 3 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:topic {:id 6
          :topic-category-id 3
          :title "4juV71q9Ih9eE1"
          :created-by-id 2
          :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:post {:id 10 :topic-id 6 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:like {:id 14 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 1}]
 [:like {:id 17 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 2}]
 [:user {:id 20 :username "b73Ts5BoO"}]
 [:like {:id 21 :post-id 10 :created-by-id 20}]]
```

Three Likes, Three different Users, and we're not violating the
uniqueness constraint. With just one line of code. I think this
feature is particularly cool.

### Polymorphic relations

Whereas foreign keys in RDBMSs must reference records in a specific
table, some databases like Datomic have reference types attributes
that can reference any entity at all. You might want to use this in
your forum so that users can like either Topics or Posts. Specmonstah
handles this use case.

There are two snippets below. In the first, you say you want to create
three `:polymorphic-like`s with `{:ref-types {:liked-id
:post}}`. Specmonstah generates 3 likes that refer to a post. The
second snippet includes `{:ref-types {:liked-id :topic}}`, so the
likes refer to a topic. Polymorphic references compose with uniqueness
constraints, so three users are created, just like in the previous snippet.

```clojure
(insert {:polymorphic-like [[3 {:ref-types {:liked-id :post}}]]})
@mock-db
[[:user {:id 1 :username "gI3q3Y6HR1uwc"}]
 [:user {:id 2 :username "klKs7"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 3 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:topic {:id 6
          :topic-category-id 3
          :title "RF6g"
          :created-by-id 2
          :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:post {:id 10 :topic-id 6 :created-by-id 2 :updated-by-id 2}]
 [:polymorphic-like {:id 14 :liked-id 10 :created-by-id 1}]
 [:polymorphic-like {:id 17 :liked-id 10 :created-by-id 2}]
 [:user {:id 20 :username "Gcf"}]
 [:polymorphic-like {:id 21 :liked-id 10 :created-by-id 20}]]


(insert {:polymorphic-like [[3 {:ref-types {:liked-id :topic}}]]})
@mock-db
[[:user {:id 1 :username "5Z382YCNrJB"}]
 [:topic-category {:id 2 :created-by-id 1 :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:topic {:id 5
          :topic-category-id 2
          :title "i3"
          :created-by-id 1
          :updated-by-id 1}]
 [:user {:id 9 :username "dJtC"}]
 [:polymorphic-like {:id 10 :liked-id 5 :created-by-id 9}]
 [:polymorphic-like {:id 13 :liked-id 5 :created-by-id 1}]
 [:user {:id 16 :username "8ZS"}]
 [:polymorphic-like {:id 17 :liked-id 5 :created-by-id 16}]]
```


### Visualization

Sometimes you want to inspect all the work that Specmonstah is doing
for you. One way to do that is to produce an image of the entities
Specmonstah produces, and their relationships:

```clojure
(lio/view (:data (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:like [[2]]})))
```

![like graph](docs/like-graph.png)

This shows that that two Likes were generated (`l0` and `l1`). The
Likes are applied to a Post (`p0`), and so forth.

And that brings the infomercial to a close. If you're ready to learn
how you, too, can accomplish these amazing feats, read on!

## Tutorial

Specmonstah was born out of a need to replace brittle, repetitive code
for creating deeply-nested hierarchies of data in unit tests. This
tutorial will show you how to use Specmonstah specifically for this
use case. Along the way you'll learn how to make the most of
Specmonstah by understanding how it's not implemented to support
writing unit tests per se, but to support the more fundamental
operations of generating and manipulating entity graphs.

In trying to figure out how to explain this I had the thought,
"Specmonstah is all about _data_ and _the stuff you can do with that
data_. It felt super profound, like I had gotten a direct glimpse of
the underlying structure of the cosmos. Real "shower thoughts" moment.

We'll start with a high-level overview of how Specmonstah's `data` and
`operations` support the overall goal of aiding testing by generating
and inserting records in a database in dependency order.

### Data & Operations

Specmonstah's data and operations can be summarized as:

* Data
  * ent db
    * schema
    * ent graph
    * ent attrs
* Operations
  * add ents
  * add ent attrs (ent visitation)
  * create views of the ent graph

To explain each of these bullets, we'll work through the following
questions:

* How does Specmonstah generate data for database insertion?
* How does Specmonstah insert records in the correct order?

Data generation happens in two phases:

1. You _add ents_ to an _ent db_'s _ent graph_
2. You add the data generated by clojure.spec to each ent as an _ent
   attr_

Let's unpack this.

Specmonstah works by generating an _ent graph_. Say you want to
generate and insert three `todo`s that references a `todo-list`, where
the `todo`s and the `todo-list` all reference a `user`.  Specmonstah
accomplishes this by first creating a graph like this:

![Simple todo example](docs/todo-example.png)

In the graph above, we call the `:todo`, `:todo-list`, and `:user`
nodes _ent types_ and the rest _ents_. We use these names in
Specmonstah to indicate that these graph nodes take on a particular
meaning in Specmonstah:

**Ent type.** An ent type is analogous to a relation in a relational
database, or a class in object-oriented programming. It differs in
that relations and classes define all the attributes of their
instances, whereas ent types don't. Ent types define how instances are
related to each other. For example, a Todo schema might include a
`:description` attribute, but the `:todo` ent type doesn't. The
`:todo` ent type _does_ specify that a `:todo` instances reference
`:todo-list` instances.

Ent types are represented as nodes in the ent graph (let's abbreviate
that with _EG_), with directed edges going from ent types to their
instances. It's rare that you'll interact with ent types directly.

**Ent.** An ent is an instance of an ent type. Ents have names (`:t0,
:u0`, etc), and reference other ents. They're represented as nodes in
the EG, with directed edges going from ents to the ents they
reference; there's a directed edge from `:tl0` to `:u0` because `:tl0`
references `:u0`. The graph's topology is used to ensure that `:u0`
gets inserted before `:tl0`.

In creating the above graph, we would say that we _add ents_ to an
_ent db_. An ent db is a map that contains an ent graph.

The ent db also contains a _schema_. The schema describes how ents of
different types refer to each other, and it's used to construct the
directed edges between ents.

So that's the first step of data generation: You _add ents_ to an _ent
db_'s _ent graph_. After that, you add the data generated by
clojure.spec to each ent as an _ent attr_.

For example, the ents `:u0` and `:tl0` are not maps. They're just a
graph node, and as such they cannot be inserted in a
database. Specmonstah uses clojure.spec to generate data for `:u0` and
`:tl0` and then associates the data with `:u0` and `:tl0` as an _ent
attr_. You can think of this as being represented using a map like
this, with `:spec-gen` as the ent attr:

```
{:u0  {:spec-gen {:username "billy"
                  :id       1}}
 :tl0 {:spec-gen {:id       2
                  :owner-id 1
                  :title    "my todaloo list"}}}
```

The process of adding ent attrs is called _visitation_. Visiting ent
nodes is kind of like mapping: when you call `map` on a seq, you apply
a mapping function to each element, creating a new seq from the
mapping function's return values. By the same token, when you visit
ents you apply a visiting function to each ent. The visiting
function's return value is stored as an attribute on the ent - in this
case, `:spec-gen`.

Visitation happens in reverse topologically sorted order, meaning that
since `:tl0` has directed edge pointing to `:u0`, the visiting
function is applied to `:u0` before `:tl0`. This is how the spec data
generating visiting function is able to correctly set `:owner-id` to
`1`:

1. The visiting function is applied to `:u0`, generating the `:id` `1`
2. The visiting function is applied to `:tl0`. It's able to use the
   edge from `:tl0` to `:u0` to look up `:u0`'s `:id` and setting that
   as the value for `:owner-id`.

This visitation process is used to insert records in a database. The
insertions happen in the correct order, satisfying foreign key
constraints.

One more note: When you play with Specmonstah in a REPL, you'll notice
that it generates a lot of data. Specmonstah provides a bunch of
functions that project different views of the ent db so that you can
focus just on whatever's relevant for you.

That covers the main data structures and operations:

* Data
  * ent db
    * schema
    * ent graph
    * ent attrs
* Operations
  * add ents
  * add ent attrs (ent visitation)
  * create views of the ent graph

Now that you have the broad picture of how Specmonstah works, let's
start exploring the details with source code. The rest of the tutorial
consists of sections with corresponding clojure files under the
[](tutorial/reifyhealth/specmonstah_tutorial) directory, each
introducing new concepts. You'll have the best experience if you
follow along in a REPL.

### 01: ent db

In this section you're going to learn about the _ent db_. Open
[reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.01](tutorial/reifyhealth/specmonstah_tutorial/01.clj):

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.01
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [loom.io :as lio]))

(def schema
  {:user {:prefix :u}})

(defn ex-01
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:user [[3]]}))
```

Throughout the tutorial, I'll use functions named `ex-01`, `ex-02`,
etc, to illustrate some concept. When you call `(ex-01)`, it returns:

```clojure
(ex-01) ;=>
{:schema {:user {:prefix :u}}
 :data {:nodeset #{:u1 :u0 :u2 :user}
        :adj {:user #{:u1 :u0 :u2}}
        :in {:u0 #{:user} :u1 #{:user} :u2 #{:user}}
        :attrs {:user {:type :ent-type}
                :u0 {:type :ent, :index 0, :ent-type :user, :query-term [3]}
                :u1 {:type :ent, :index 1, :ent-type :user, :query-term [3]}
                :u2 {:type :ent, :index 2, :ent-type :user, :query-term [3]}}}
 :queries ({:user [[3]]})
 :relation-graph {:nodeset #{:user} :adj {} :in {}}
 :types #{:user}
 :ref-ents []}
 ```

`ex-01` invokes the function call `(sm/add-ents {:schema schema}
{:user [[3]]})`. You'll always call `sm/add-ents` first whenever
you use Specmonstah. It takes two arguments, an _ent db_ and a
_query_, and returns an ent db.

ent db's are at the core of Specmonstah; most functions take an ent db
as their first argument and return an ent db. The ent db is
conceptually similar to the databases you're familiar with. Its
`:schema` key refers to an entity schema, just as an RDBMS includes
schema information. In this case, the schema is `{:user {:prefix
:u}}`, which is as simple a schema as possible. In later sections,
you'll learn more about schemas and how they're used to define
relationships and constraints among ents.

The ent db's `:data` key refers to a
[graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)
representing ents, their relationships, and their _ent attributes_ (as
opposed to business attributes). In this ent db there are three users,
`:u0`, `:u1`, and `:u2`. There aren't any ent relationships because
our schema didn't specify any, but each ent does have attributes:
`:type`, `:index`, `:ent-type`, and `:query-term`. I know I've said it
multiple times already, but these are _ent attributes_, which are
distinct from _business attributes_. The latter are the attributes
related to whatever domain you're modeling; for users, these might
include name, username, email address, and so forth. As you go through
the tutorial, you'll see how a lot of Specmonstah functions involve
reading and updating ents' attributes.

The graph also includes nodes for ent types; you can see `:user`, and
ent-type, under the `:nodeset` key of the graph. This is used
internally.

It happens that the graph
is produced by [loom](https://github.com/aysylu/loom), a sweet little
library for working with graphs. Specmonstah doesn't try to hide this
implementation detail from you: it's entirely possible you'll want to
use one of loom's many useful graph functions to interact with the
ent db's data. You might, for instance, want to render the graph as an
image. Try this in your REPL:

```clojure
(lio/view (:data (ex-01)))
```

At the same time, viewing the full loom graph is often overwhelming
and unnecessary. The following functions help you project a more
useful view of the ent db:

```clojure
(-> (ex-01)
    (sm/ents-by-type))

(-> (ex-01)
    (sm/ent-relations :u0))

(-> (ex-01)
    (sm/all-ent-relations))
```

I encourage you to try these functions out in the REPL. Some of them
reveal information about ent relationships and so will only be useful
when we're working with more than one ent type; try those functions
out in the next section as well as you can get a better idea of what
they do.

Back to the ent db: The rest of the keys (`:queries`,
`:relation-graph`, `:types`, `:ref-ents`) are used internally to
generate the ent db, and can safely be ignored.

Adding ents to an ent db is the first step whenever you're using
Specmonstah. The two main ingredients for building an ent db are the
_query_ and _schema_. In the next section, we'll explain how schemas
work, and section 3 will explain queries.

### 02: Schemas

Here's the source for this chapter:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.02
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [loom.io :as lio]))

(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}})


(defn ex-01
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[2]]}))
```

The ent db's schema defines ent types. It's implemented as a map where
keys are the ent types' names and values are their definitions. In the
code above, `schema` defines two ent types, `:user` and
`:todo-list`. The ent type definitions include two keys, `:prefix` and
`:relations`.

`:prefix` is used by `add-ents` to name the ents it creates. For
example, in `ex-01`, we produce an ent db that has two todo-lists and
a user:

```clojure
(defn ex-01
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[2]]}))

(lio/view (:data (ex-01)))

(-> (ex-01) (sm/ents-by-type))

(-> (ex-01) (sm/ent-relations :u0))

(-> (ex-01) (sm/all-ent-relations))
```

![prefixes](docs/02/prefixes.png)

The todo-lists are named `:tl0` and `:tl1`, and the user is
`:u0`. There's a pattern here: every generated ent is named
`:{schema-prefix}{index}`.

The schema's `:relations` key is used to specify how ents are related
to each other. The `:todo-list` definition includes `:relations
{:owner-id [:user :id]}`, specifying that a `:todo-list` should
reference a `:user`. The relation also specifies that the
`:todo-list`'s `:owner-id` should be set to the `:user`'s `:id`,
information that will be used when we use spec-gen to generate records
for these ents.

It's because of this relation that the query `{:todo-list [[2]]}`
results in the `:user` `:u0` being created even though the query
doesn't explicitly mention `:user`, and that the `:todo-list`s
`:tl0` and `:tl1` reference `:u0`.

### 03: Queries

Section 3's source file begins:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.03
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [loom.io :as lio]))

(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}})
(defn ex-01
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[2]]}))
```


Queries are used to specify what ents should get generated. The term
_query_ might throw you off because usually it's used to refer to the
language for _retrieving_ records from a database. In Specmonstah, I
think of queries as allowing you to express, _generate the minimal
ent-db necessary for me to retrieve the ents I've specified_.

In `ex-01`, the query passed to `sm/add-ents` is `{:todo-list
[[2]]}`. This is like saying, _I want two `:todo-list`s. Create an
ent-db with the minimum ents needed so that I can retrieve them._
Because `:todo-list` ents must refer to a `:user`, Specmonstah
generates the `:user` ent `:u0`. Specmonstah only generates one
`:user`, not two, because that's the minimum needed to satisfy the
query.

Queries are maps, where each key is the name of an ent type, and each
value is a vector of _query terms_. In the query `{:todo-list [[2]]}`,
`:todo-list` is an ent type and `[2]` is a query term.

Each query term is a vector where the first element is either a number
or an _ent name_. When you provide a number, as in `[2]`, you're
instructing SM to generate that many ents of the given ent type, and
to name them according to its default naming system. As we saw in the
last section, SM names ents by appending an index to the ent type's
`:prefix`. The `:prefix` for `:todo-list` is `:tl`, so the
`:todo-list` ents are named `:tl0` and `:tl1`. Figuring out what to
name your test data is one of the tedious aspects of testing that SM
handles for you.

On the other hand, if you _do_ want to name an ent, you can provide a
keyword as the first element in the query term, as in `ex-02`:

```clojure
(defn ex-02
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[:my-todo-list]
                                                 [:my-todoodle-do-list]]}))

(lio/view (:data (ex-02)))
```

![custom names](docs/03/custom-names.png)

Here, you're naming your `:todo-list` ents `:my-todo-list` and, in a
fit of whimsy, `:my-todoodle-do-list`.

You can add as many query terms to an ent type as you want, mixing
numbers and ent names as you please:

```clojure
(defn ex-03
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[1]
                                                 [:work]
                                                 [1]
                                                 [:cones-of-dunshire-club]]}))

```

![custom names](docs/03/cones.png)

Query terms take a second argument, an options map map, which is used
to further tune the creation of the ent. The next section will show
you how to use the options map to generate unique references.

### 04: refs

In all the examples so far, all the todo lists have referred to the
same user, `:u0`. What if you want to create two todo lists, but you
want them to belong to different users? Here's how you could do that:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.04
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [loom.io :as lio]))

(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}
   :todo      {:prefix :t
               :relations {:todo-list-id [:todo-list :id]}}})
(defn ex-01
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[2 {:refs {:owner-id :my-own-sweet-user}}]
                                                 [1]]}))

(lio/view (:data (ex-01)))
```

![custom refs](docs/04/custom-ref.png)

What's new in this example is the map `{:refs {:owner-id
:my-own-sweet-user}}`. It resulted in two todo lists, `:tl0` and
`:tl1`, referring to a `:user` ent named `:my-own-sweet-user` instead
of `:u0`. Let's break this down.

In the `schema`, `:todo-list` includes this relations definition:

```clojure
:relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}
```

This means, _`:todo-list`s refer to a user via the `:owner-id`
attribute_. Remember that queries are essentially telling Specmonstah,
_generate the minimal ent-db necessary for me to retrieve the ents
I've specified_, so when you call the `add-ents` function and
instruct SM to generate a `:todo-list`, SM's default behavior is to
satisfy this schema definition by creating a `:user` and naming it
according to its default naming system. Internally, the ent db tracks
that the `:todo-list` refers to the `:user` via the `:owner-id`
attribute.

However, when your query includes the option `{:refs {:owner-id
:my-own-sweet-user}}`, you're saying, _I want the user that
`:owner-id` refers to to be named `:my-own-sweet-user`_. One way you
might use this would be to write a test ensuring that users can't
modify each others' todo lists.

If you look back at the schema for this section, you'll notice it
introduced a new ent type, `:todo`, and `:todo`s reference
`:todo-list`s. What if you wanted to create two todo lists, each with
one todo and each belonging to a different user? Here's how you could
do that:

```clojure
(defn ex-02
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[1]
                                                 [1 {:refs {:owner-id :hamburglar}}]]
                                     :todo      [[1]
                                                 [1 {:refs {:todo-list-id :tl1}}]]}))

(lio/view (:data (ex-02)))
```

![implicit refs](docs/04/hamburglar.png)

Before reading the explanation of how this works, indulge the educator
in me and take a moment to write or say your own explanation. Quizzing
yourself like this is an effective way to clarify and retain your
understanding. There's all kinds of studies that show it; it's called
"the testing effect" and it's one of the best ways to learn.

Let's break this query down term by term:

```clojure
{:todo-list [[1]
             [1 {:refs {:owner-id :hamburglar}}]]
 :todo      [[1]
             [1 {:refs {:todo-list-id :tl1}}]]}
```

Under `:todo-list`, `[1]` tells Specmonstah to create a
`:todo-list`. It's given the default name `:tl0`. Since you didn't
specify any refs, it refers to the default user, `:u0`.

The next query term, `[1 {:refs {:owner-id :hamburglar}}]`, instructs
SM to create a `:todo-list` that refers to a user named, of all
things, `:hamburglar`. This `:todo-list` is given the default name of
`:tl1`.

Under `:todo`, `[1]` tells Specmonstah to create a `:todo` with a
default name and default refs. Therefore, `:t0` refers to `:tl0`.

The next term, `[1 {:refs {:todo-list-id :tl1}}]`, tells SM that the
next `:todo` should refer to the `:todo-list` named `:tl1`. We
specified the `:tl1` here because we know that Specmonstah's simple,
consistent naming system will produce that name for the second
`:todo-list` specified in the query.

The point of all this is that you can rely on Specmonstah's naming
system to reliably and concisely establish the properties and
relations of the ent db you want to generate. If you don't want to
keep track of Specmonstah's implicit names, you can name things
explicitly:

```clojure
(defn ex-03
  []
  (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[:tl0]
                                                 [:tl1 {:refs {:owner-id :hamburglar}}]]
                                     :todo      [[1 {:refs {:todo-list-id :tl0}}]
                                                 [1 {:refs {:todo-list-id :tl1}}]]}))
```

### 05: Progressive construction

At the beginning of this tutorial, I told you that `add-ents` takes a
schema as an argument:

```clojure
(sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})
```

You may have wondered why the map `{:schema schema}` is used, rather
than just directly passing in `schema`; why don't we just write this?

```clojure
(sm/add-ents schema {:todo [[1]]})
```

The reason is that `add-ents` actually takes an ent db as its
first argument. When you pass in `{:schema schema}`, you're passing in
an ent db with no data. However, you can take the return value of
`add-ents` and pass it in as the first argument to further calls
to `add-ents`:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.05
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [loom.io :as lio]))

(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}
   :todo      {:prefix :t
               :relations {:todo-list-id [:todo-list :id]}}})

(defn ex-01
  []
  (let [ent-db-1 (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[1]]})
        ent-db-2 (sm/add-ents ent-db-1 {:todo-list [[1] [1 {:refs {:owner-id :hamburglar}}]]})]
    (lio/view (:data ent-db-1))
    (lio/view (:data ent-db-2))))

(ex-01)
```

Additional calls to `add-ents` are additive; they will never alter
existing ents, and will only add new ents. The first call,
`(sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[1]]})`, produces a
`:todo-list` named `:tl0` referencing a `:user` named `:u0`:

![progressive generation 1](docs/05/progressive-1.png)

That ent db is passed to the next call, `(sm/add-ents ent-db-1
{:todo-list [[1] [1 {:refs {:owner-id :hamburglar}}]]})`. This creates
two more todo lists:

![progressive generation](docs/05/progressive.png)

The default naming system picks up where it left off, giving the todo
lists the names `:tl1` and `:tl2`. `:tl1` references the existing
user, `:u0`, and `:tl2` references a new user from the `:refs`,
`:hamburglar`. When progressively generating an ent-db, you can expect
Specmonstah to behave as if all queries were passed as a single query
to a single call of `add-ents`.

---

Everything you've learned up to this point has focused on generating
an ent db: you've learned a bit about how to use schemas and queries
together to concisely specify what ents to create. You've also learned
how to customize the relationships with the `:refs` query option.

In the next couple sections, you'll learn about how Specmonstah uses
_visitation_ to generate and insert business data.

### 06: spec-gen

If you're not familiar with clojure.spec, check out [the spec guide on
clojure.org](https://clojure.org/guides/spec). It's very well-written.

Our code:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.06
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [loom.io :as lio]
            [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
            [clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen]
            [reifyhealth.specmonstah.spec-gen :as sg]))

(s/def ::id (s/and pos-int? #(< % 100)))
(s/def ::not-empty-string (s/and string? not-empty #(< (count %) 20)))

(s/def ::username ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::user (s/keys :req-un [::id ::username]))

(s/def ::name ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::owner-id ::id)
(s/def ::todo-list (s/keys :req-un [::id ::name ::owner-id]))

(s/def ::details ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::todo-list-id ::id)
(s/def ::todo (s/keys :req-un [::id ::details ::todo-list-id]))

(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u
               :spec   ::user}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :spec      ::todo-list
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}
   :todo      {:prefix    :t
               :spec     ::todo
               :relations {:todo-list-id [:todo-list :id]}}})

(defn ex-01
  []
  {:user      (gen/generate (s/gen ::user))
   :todo-list (gen/generate (s/gen ::todo-list))
   :todo      (gen/generate (s/gen ::todo))})
```

We define some simple specs to generate a little dummy data. Here's
what the raw generated data looks like:

```clojure
(ex-01) ;=>
{:user      {:id 2, :username "qI0iNgiy"}
 :todo-list {:id 4, :name "etIZ3l6jDO7m9UR5P", :owner-id 11}
 :todo      {:id 1, :details "1K85jiEU3L366NTx1", :todo-list-id 2}}
```

That's useful, but we can't insert that into a test database because
the foreign keys wouldn't match the values they reference. The
`:todo-list`'s `:user-id`, for example, is `11`, where the `:user`'s
`:id` is 2.

We can use `reifyhealth.specmonstah.spec-gen/ent-db-spec-gen` to
generate data and then assign the foreign keys:

```clojure
(defn ex-02
  []
  (:data (sg/ent-db-spec-gen {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})))

(ex-02)
; =>
{:nodeset #{:todo-list :tl0 :t0 :u0 :todo :user},
 :adj {:todo #{:t0},
       :t0 #{:tl0},
       :todo-list #{:tl0},
       :tl0 #{:u0},
       :user #{:u0}},
 :in {:t0 #{:todo}, :tl0 #{:todo-list :t0}, :u0 #{:tl0 :user}},
 :attrs {:todo {:type :ent-type},
         :t0 {:type :ent,
              :index 0,
              :ent-type :todo,
              :query-term [1],
              :loom.attr/edge-attrs {:tl0 {:relation-attrs #{:todo-list-id}}},
              :spec-gen {:id 1, :details "uhr5LSa", :todo-list-id 8}},
         :todo-list {:type :ent-type},
         :tl0 {:type :ent,
               :index 0,
               :ent-type :todo-list,
               :query-term [:_],
               :loom.attr/edge-attrs {:u0 {:relation-attrs #{:owner-id}}},
               :spec-gen {:id 8, :name "xbamqBULZ", :owner-id 42}},
         :user {:type :ent-type},
         :u0 {:type :ent,
              :index 0,
              :ent-type :user,
              :query-term [:_],
              :spec-gen {:id 42, :username "abrfR4s1I15"}}}}
```

Oh wow, OK. That's a lot to look at. Let's step through it.

We're looking at the value for the ent db's `:data` key. This is the
loom graph that we've looked at in earlier sections, the graph
returned by `add-ents` that captures ents and their
relationships. Under the `:attrs` key, you can see that each ent
(`:t0`, `:tl0`, and `:u0`) now has the attribute `:spec-gen`. Under
`:spec-gen` is a map that's been generated using clojure.spec, except
that the foreign keys have been updated to be correct.

Sometimes you want to view the data that clojure.spec has
generated. To make that easier, Specmonstah has the
`reifyhealth.specmonstah.core/attr-map` function:

```clojure
(defn ex-03
  []
  (-> (sg/ent-db-spec-gen {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})
      (sm/attr-map :spec-gen)))

(ex-03)
;; =>
{:tl0 {:id 21, :name "0N2xKMNwM8uO", :owner-id 19}
 :t0  {:id 4, :details "PGf92", :todo-list-id 21}
 :u0  {:id 19, :username "fz774"}}
```

`attr-map` returns a map where the keys are ent names and the values
are the value of the given node attribute (`:spec-gen` here) for each
ent. There's a convenience function that combines `sg/ent-db-spec-gen`
and `sm/attr-map`, `sg/ent-db-spec-gen-attr`:

```clojure
(defn ex-04
  []
  (sg/ent-db-spec-gen-attr {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]}))

(ex-04)

### 07: spec gen customization and omission

You can override the values produces by `ent-db-spec-gen` in the
query:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.07
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [loom.io :as lio]
            [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
            [clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen]
            [reifyhealth.specmonstah.spec-gen :as sg]))

(s/def ::id (s/and pos-int? #(< % 100)))
(s/def ::not-empty-string (s/and string? not-empty #(< (count %) 20)))

(s/def ::username ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::user (s/keys :req-un [::id ::username]))

(s/def ::name ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::owner-id ::id)
(s/def ::todo-list (s/keys :req-un [::id ::name ::owner-id]))

(s/def ::details ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::todo-list-id ::id)
(s/def ::todo (s/keys :req-un [::id ::details ::todo-list-id]))

(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u
               :spec   ::user}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :spec      ::todo-list
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}
   :todo      {:prefix    :t
               :spec     ::todo
               :relations {:todo-list-id [:todo-list :id]}}})

(defn ex-01
  []
  (sg/ent-db-spec-gen-attr {:schema schema}
                           {:user [[1 {:spec-gen {:username "bob"}}]]
                            :todo [[1 {:spec-gen {:details "get groceries"}}]]}))

(ex-01)
;; =>
{:tl0 {:id 48, :name "C8Cj51DSbZIb69Z", :owner-id 2}
 :t0  {:id 21, :details "get groceries", :todo-list-id 48}
 :u0  {:id 2, :username "bob"}}
```

You can also specify that you don't want an ent to reference one of
the ents defined in its schema. For example, if a `:todo-list`'s
`:owner-id` is optional and you don't want it to be present, you could
do this:

```clojure
(defn ex-02
  []
  (sg/ent-db-spec-gen-attr {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[1 {:refs {:owner-id ::sm/omit}}]]}))

(ex-02)
;; =>
{:tl0 {:id 2, :name "v"}}
```

`::sm/omit` prevents the referenced ent from even being created in the
ent db. spec generation respects this and omits `:owner-id` from the
map it generates. If you want `:owner-id` to be `nil`, you'd have to
specify that like this:

```
(defn ex-03
  []
  (sg/ent-db-spec-gen-attr {:schema schema} {:todo-list [[1 {:refs     {:owner-id ::sm/omit}
                                                             :spec-gen {:owner-id nil}}]]}))

(ex-03)
;; =>
{:tl0 {:id 2, :name "pijm" :owner-id nil}}
```

### 08: Visiting functions

You now have most of the pieces you need to generate and insert
fixture data into a test database. Now you just need to... actually
insert the data! To insert data you must _visit_ each ent in the ent
db with a _visiting function_, and that's what you'll learn to do in
this section and the next.

Earlier I wrote,

You've actually already seen a visiting function at work. In the last
couple sections you learned how to use spec to generate a value for
each ent. The generated value was stored under the `:spec-gen`
attribute; that's because the `sg/ent-db-spec-gen` you called actually
applies a visiting function to the ent db it generates. Let's create
our own visiting function so you can see how this works:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.08
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]))


(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}
   :todo      {:prefix    :t
               :relations {:todo-list-id [:todo-list :id]}}})

(defn announce
  [db {:keys [ent-name]}]
  (str "announcing... " ent-name "!"))

(defn ex-01
  []
  (-> (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})
      (sm/visit-ents :announce announce)
      (get-in [:data :attrs])))

(ex-01)
;; =>
{:todo {:type :ent-type},
 :t0
 {:type :ent,
  :index 0,
  :ent-type :todo,
  :query-term [1],
  :loom.attr/edge-attrs {:tl0 {:relation-attrs #{:todo-list-id}}},
  :announce "announcing... :t0!"},
 :todo-list {:type :ent-type},
 :tl0
 {:type :ent,
  :index 0,
  :ent-type :todo-list,
  :query-term [:_],
  :loom.attr/edge-attrs {:u0 {:relation-attrs #{:owner-id}}},
  :announce "announcing... :tl0!"},
 :user {:type :ent-type},
 :u0
 {:type :ent,
  :index 0,
  :ent-type :user,
  :query-term [:_],
  :announce "announcing... :u0!"}}
```

`(ex-01)` creates an ent db, applies a visiting function, and then
looks up the `:attrs` key in the graph associated with the ent db's
`:data` key. The `:attrs` key is where loom stores each node's
attributes. We can see that each ent (`:u0`, `:t0`, `:tl0`) has an
attribute with the key `:announce` and the value of
`"announcing... :ent-name!"`. Let's walk through this. You call the
function `ex-01`, whose body is:

```clojure
(-> (sm/add-ents {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})
    (sm/visit-ents :announce announce)
    (get-in [:data :attrs]))
```

`sm/add-ents` builds the ent db and passes it to `sm/visit-ents`.
`sm/visit-ents` takes three arguments: the ent db, a _visit key_, and
a visiting function. Then, internally, `sm/visits-ents` iterates overs
each ent in the ent db, passing the ent's name to the visiting
function along with the db and visit key, using the return value to
assign an attribute to the ent.

So in the above example, the ents are `:u0`, `:tl0`, and `:t0`, and
`sm/visit-ents` iterates over them in that order. For `:u0`, it passes
the following arguments to the visiting function `announce`:

1. the ent db
2. the ent name, `:u0`
3. the visit key, `:announce`

The return value of `announce` is `"announcing... :u0!"`, and that
gets associated with the `:announce` key under the ent's attributes.

I'm concerned that this part of the tutorial isn't clear enough, and I
hope to be able to improve it. In the mean time, if you're still
struggling with visiting functions, try guessing what would happen if
you changed the arguments to `sm/visit-ents`, then actually change the
arguments and see if your guess was correct.

### 09: An insertion visiting function

In this section you'll look at how you could insert the data
Specmonstah has generated into a database. We'll be adding the data to
an atom, but you can apply the idea to your own database. The code:

```clojure
(ns reifyhealth.specmonstah-tutorial.09
  (:require [reifyhealth.specmonstah.core :as sm]
            [reifyhealth.specmonstah.spec-gen :as sg]
            [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]))

(s/def ::id (s/and pos-int? #(< % 100)))
(s/def ::not-empty-string (s/and string? not-empty #(< (count %) 20)))

(s/def ::username ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::user (s/keys :req-un [::id ::username]))

(s/def ::name ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::owner-id ::id)
(s/def ::todo-list (s/keys :req-un [::id ::name ::owner-id]))

(s/def ::details ::not-empty-string)
(s/def ::todo-list-id ::id)
(s/def ::todo (s/keys :req-un [::id ::details ::todo-list-id]))

(def schema
  {:user      {:prefix :u
               :spec   ::user}
   :todo-list {:prefix    :tl
               :spec      ::todo-list
               :relations {:owner-id [:user :id]}}
   :todo      {:prefix    :t
               :spec     ::todo
               :relations {:todo-list-id [:todo-list :id]}}})

(def database (atom []))

(defn insert
  [db {:keys [ent-type ent-val spec-gen]}]
  (when-not ent-val
    (swap! database conj [ent-type spec-gen])))

(defn ex-01
  []
  (reset! database [])
  (-> (sg/ent-db-spec-gen {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})
      (sm/visit-ents :insert insert))
  @database)

(ex-01)
;; =>
[[:user {:id 6, :username "Ov0zaH57lTk86bAh"}]
 [:todo-list {:id 23, :name "9", :owner-id 6}]
 [:todo {:id 2, :details "hf", :todo-list-id 23}]]
```

The specs and schema should be familiar by now. Looking at the `ex-01`
function, we see that it calls `sg/ent-db-spec-gen`. As you saw
earlier, this creates the ent db and uses clojure.spec to generate a
map for each ent, storing the map under the ent's `:spec-gen`
attribute. The resulting ent db is passed to `sm/visit-ents` with the
visit key `:insert` and visiting function `insert`.


`insert` works by:

* Checking whether this ent has already been inserted
* If not, updating the `database` atom by conjing a vector of the
  ent's type and the value generated by `spec-gen`.

Let's go through `insert` line by line:

```clojure
(defn insert
  [db {:keys [ent-type ent-val spec-gen]}]
  (when-not ent-val
    (swap! database conj [ent-type spec-gen])))
```

The second argument to all visiting functions is a map that includes:

* All of the ent's attributes (like `:spec-gen`)
* `:ent-val`, the value from previous visits if there have been any
* `:visit-key` - when the visiting function returns, its value is
  added as an ent attr using the key `:visit-key`
* `:query-opts` - any query opts like `{:refs {} :spec-gen {}}` for
  the ent
* `:visit-query-opts` - any query opts meant for this visiting fn

`(when-not ent-val ...)`, checks whether `insert` has already visited
this ent. (I'll explain why you want to perform this check soon.) If
the ent hasn't been visited, the `database` gets updated by conjing a
vector of the `ent-type` and `spec-gen`. The `database` atom ends up
with a value like this:

```clojure
[[:user {:id 6, :username "Ov0zaH57lTk86bAh"}]
 [:todo-list {:id 23, :name "9", :owner-id 6}]
 [:todo {:id 2, :details "hf", :todo-list-id 23}]]
 ```

Each ent is inserted in dependency order: `:user` first, then
`:todo-list`, then `:todo`.

Now let's revisit `(when-not ent-val ...)`. You want to perform this
check because of Specmonstah's progressive construction feature: as we
covered in [05: Progressive
construction](#05-progressive-construction), it's possible to pass an
ent-db to successive calls to `sm/add-ents`. If you added more ents
and wanted to insert, you wouldn't want to re-insert previous
ents. `ex-02` demonstrates this:

```clojure
(defn ex-02
  []
  (reset! database [])
  (-> (sg/ent-db-spec-gen {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})
      (sm/visit-ents :insert insert)
      (sg/ent-db-spec-gen {:todo [[3]]})
      (sm/visit-ents :insert insert))
  @database)

(ex-02)
;; =>
[[:user {:id 23, :username "0B1E5Iq4QWz4q"}]
 [:todo-list {:id 16, :name "gt", :owner-id 23}]
 [:todo {:id 17, :details "wN92", :todo-list-id 16}]
 [:todo {:id 3, :details "cQOav9DBqI8M57", :todo-list-id 16}]
 [:todo {:id 8, :details "Ek065tC78bD9wEJwLa", :todo-list-id 16}]
 [:todo {:id 5, :details "9", :todo-list-id 16}]]
```

The `:user`, `:todo-list`, and `:todo` ents from the first call to
`ent-db-spec-gen` are only inserted once, even though they are visited
by `insert` multiple times.

In fact, recall that `ent-db-spec-gen` internally calls
`sm/add-ents` and then calls the `sg/spec-gen` visiting
function. `sg/spec-gen` is written with this same principle in mind:
it can visit the ent db multiple times, and won't overwrite any
existing values. The pattern is common enough that Specmonstah
provides the `sm/visit-ents-once` which you can use instead of
`sm/visit-ents`:

```clojure
(defn insert-once
  [db {:keys [ent-type spec-gen]}]
  (swap! database conj [ent-type spec-gen])
  true)

(defn ex-03
  []
  (reset! database [])
  (-> (sg/ent-db-spec-gen {:schema schema} {:todo [[1]]})
      (sm/visit-ents-once :insert insert-once)
      (sg/ent-db-spec-gen {:todo [[3]]})
      (sm/visit-ents-once :insert insert-once))
  @database)

(ex-03)
;; =>
[[:user {:id 2, :username "S"}]
 [:todo-list {:id 2, :name "58Zb3p0Y75BJZS1m", :owner-id 2}]
 [:todo {:id 2, :details "OHqbuPz", :todo-list-id 2}]
 [:todo {:id 13, :details "3v7rllHTps1r6gN3", :todo-list-id 2}]
 [:todo {:id 27, :details "5nn24T029w7Z9KBUXE", :todo-list-id 2}]
 [:todo {:id 2, :details "zV37csm519blvP3r", :todo-list-id 2}]]
```

With this coverage of `visit-ents` and `visit-ents-once`, you should
be able to handle most use cases. Specmonstah handles other corner
cases (like inserting records in the correct order when there are
cycles.) This guide is a work in progress, and those usages aren't
covered yet. However, every use case is covered in the test suite, so
if you're running into an issue, check the tests first.

I'm looking to exercise Specmonstah 2 against the following use cases:

* Generating data for unit tests. What to look for:
  * Are there surprises?
  * Can it handle deeply nested combinations of `:coll` and `:uniq`
    relationships?
  * Does binding work as expected?
  * Is it easy to retrieve the views of the specmonstah db needed for
    a test? For example, if you want to generate 2 Todos for
    insertion, but a TodoList and a User also get generated, can you
    access just the Todos with minimal code?
* Generating seed data.
  * Can you easily and clearly specify an entire database? For
    example, can you express "I want to create a db with 3 todo lists
    belonging to 2 users, where one list has 5 items, one has 1, and
    one has 0".
  * Can you easily tweak the above? For example if you want to create
    an additional todo list but leave everything else the same, or
    generate only empty todo lists.
* Progressively generating and mapping a database.
  * Does anything unexpected happen if you create an entity database
    and map over it to perform inserts over multiple calls?
